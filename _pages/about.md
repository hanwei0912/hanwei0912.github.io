Hi! Welcome to my homepage.

I am a Postdoc researcher working with [Prof.Holger Hermanns](https://depend.cs.uni-saarland.de/~hermanns/) and [Prof. Lijun Zhang](https://tis.ios.ac.cn/?page_id=148) since November 2023. Currently, I am working on the project of [Explainable Intelligent Systems](https://explainable-intelligent.systems/), as well as a project about the adversarial attack against 3D object detection in autonomous driving.

From July 2021 to July 2023, I served as a Post-doctoral researcher on [QARMA](https://qarma.lis-lab.fr/) team of LIS Marseille, working on Interpretability of Deep Neural Network with [Ronan Sicre](https://pageperso.lis-lab.fr/~ronan.sicre/wordpress/), and [Yannis Avrithis](https://avrithis.net/). 

I defended my Ph.D thesis "Deep Learning in Adversarial Context" on June 17 2021. My Ph.D was supervised by [Laurent Amsaleg](http://people.rennes.inria.fr/Laurent.Amsaleg/), [Yannis Avrithis](https://avrithis.net/) and [Teddy Furon](http://people.rennes.inria.fr/Teddy.Furon/website/Welcome.html) in the [Linkmedia](https://www-linkmedia.irisa.fr/) team at [IRISA](https://www.irisa.fr/) Rennes. 
My diploma is from PRogram Of Sino-French Education for Research ([PROSFER](http://www.ens-rennes.fr/prosfer/programme-prosfer-east-china-normal-university-276624.kjsp)) between [East China Normal University](https://www.ecnu.edu.cn/) and [École normale supérieure de Rennes](http://www.ens-rennes.fr/). 
During the Ph.D, my research focus on the security problem in machine learning. Currently my work has mainly focused on trustworthy AI.

Before coming to IRISA, I worked on Multi-objective Evolutionary Computation with [Aimin Zhou](https://faculty.ecnu.edu.cn/s/1949/t/22631/main.jspy) from 2015-2017. And I received my bachelor's degree in 2015 from Department of Computer Science and Technology, East China Normal University.
