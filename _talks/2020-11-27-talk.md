I was invited to give a tutorial on adversarial attacks in deep learning for researchers attending the workshop. In this session, I introduced the background, motivation, and fundamental concepts of the problem before discussing class work on adversarial attacks and presenting state-of-the-art advancements, including our work on adversarial attacks on images. I also provided an overview of existing tools for running attacks.
