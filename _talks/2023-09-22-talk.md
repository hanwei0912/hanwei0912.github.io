I was invited to give a talk on adversarial attacks in deep learning for bachelorâ€™s students. In this session, I introduced the background, motivation, and fundamental concepts of the problem before discussing class work on adversarial attacks and presenting state-of-the-art advancements, including our work on adversarial attacks on images.
